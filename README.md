# Network-visualization-of-debts-owed-to-Italy-annual-2020-
This project visualizes the network of debtor countries owing Italy in 2020 from annualizing data extracted from the World Bank's collection 'International Debt Statistics'.

Citation included in the R script's code for producing FIGURE 2.

In the future I would like to use more complex network visualization R packages like 'ggraph' as well as the package 'networkD3' for producing interactive D3 JavaScript network graphs.
